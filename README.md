# RigNRoll-modding-java-toolkit  

Contains decompiled java classes from RignNRoll scripts.jar file and some new classes ('rickroll' namespace). Java classes with compilation errors or that causes bugs were renamed from .java to .java_broken  

Can be used to compile our scripts.jar file, with modifications, to replace the scripts.jar file from the game. Using an old version of Eclipse IDE, import this repository and configure the project and Eclipse workspace to use 'Java 1.5'. Create the scripts.jar file using Eclipse "Export" > "Runnable JAR File Export" (you must create a fake 'Launch Configuration' for this project in Eclipse).
